  ## Description
  Note taking PWA (progressive web application). This lightweight PWA utilizes indexDB for storing notes, code snippets, and anything else user's want to store. Installation is possible and this app can run offline because of the service worker that caches behind the scenes. Webpack and Workbox were used to build, bundle, and streamline this project.
